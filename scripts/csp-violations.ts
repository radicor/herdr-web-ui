/**
 * Sees the Content-Security-Policy violations a browser reports.
 *
 * The app's policy rides on every static response (`CSP_DIRECTIVES` in server/static.ts), and
 * a violation is invisible to everything else here: the browser logs it to the console and
 * fires a `securitypolicyviolation` event on the document, never an uncaught exception and
 * never a failed request. A blocked font is neither a page error nor a failed script, so a
 * directive that breaks a real surface — a new CDN font, a new `blob:` image, an inline
 * script, a third-party frame — would ship green. This reads both halves.
 *
 * `watchCsp` collects them on one page and `assertCspClean` fails the run on any of them, and
 * also fails when no policy header ever reached that page: a page served without the header
 * has nothing to violate and would pass by proving nothing.
