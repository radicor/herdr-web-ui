/**
 * The app's own Content-Security-Policy, sent as a header so it also governs the file
 * viewer (`/api/fs/*` renders a PDF in a frame and images in an <img>). Every directive
 * is here for a reason, and none of them is a guess:
 *
 * - `default-src 'self'`: the fallback for anything not named below. Nothing is fetched
 *   from another host: the API, the terminal socket, the machines event stream, the
 *   fonts (bundled woff2, `src/fonts/`), the PC bundle and the push endpoints are all
 *   same-origin, and the remote PCs are reached through this server's own /api/machines
 *   proxy rather than from the browser.
 * - `script-src 'self'`: both entry points are Vite modules (index.html), nothing in the
 *   app evaluates a string, and there is no inline handler attribute. This is the
 *   directive that matters: KaTeX output and the agent marks are the two places that put
 *   third-party HTML into the page.
 * - `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`: inline style attributes are how measured layout
 *   reaches the DOM (AgentPicker, RowMenu, Droplet, UsageMeters), and KaTeX writes one on
 *   every expression it cannot render. It is also load-bearing for the terminal itself:
 *   xterm.js builds its layers by appending a <style> element to the DOM, and a
 *   DOM-inserted <style> is subject to style-src, so without 'unsafe-inline' the pane
 *   loses its cursor and its layers. The unsafe part is styles, not script.
 * - `img-src 'self' data: blob:`: same-origin icons, pane images and file-viewer images;
 *   `blob:` for a pasted image previewed before it is uploaded; `data:` for the inline
 *   agent marks.
 * - `font-src 'self' data:`: every face is bundled (the app's own and KaTeX's, both
 *   through Vite). No font CDN. The `data:` is Vite's own inlining: an asset under ~4 KB
 *   is emitted as a data: URL inside the CSS rather than as a file, and KaTeX_Size3's
 *   3 KB woff2 is one of them. That data: is app-bundled bytes, never anything an agent
 *   or a transcript can reach. Measured in Chromium: without it the load reports one
 *   `font-src` violation per maths-bearing page, and the browser falls through to the
 *   same-origin .woff of the same face, so the maths still draws.
 * - `connect-src 'self'`: every fetch is a relative /api path, the terminal socket is
 *   window.location.host over ws:/wss: (which 'self' matches — confirmed in Chromium:
 *   an explicit `new WebSocket("ws://<same host>/ws")` and the machines event stream both
 *   connect under the enforcing header).
 * - `media-src 'self'`: the file viewer's <video>/<audio>, same-origin.
 * - `frame-src 'self'`: the PDF viewer frames /api/fs/file, same-origin.
 * - `worker-src 'self'`: the service worker is /sw.js, same-origin.
 * - `object-src 'none'`: no <object>/<embed> in the app, and none may appear.
 * - `base-uri 'self'`: no <base>, and a tag that adds one changes what every relative URL
 *   in the page means.
 * - `form-action 'self'`: every form is submitted by script, but a form that ever grows
 *   an action must not post this PC's credentials somewhere else.
 * - `frame-ancestors 'none'`: nothing frames the app itself.
